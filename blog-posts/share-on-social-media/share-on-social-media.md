In my spare time I'm drawing cartoons. After finishing one, of course I want to publish it on several social media platforms:
+ Facebook
+ Instagram
+ Twitter

On every platform I have a personal profile where I publish everything and a profile for cartoons related to developer topics [KackDev](https://kack.dev). 

My workflow currently is:
+ Publish the post at Instagram @KackDev
+ Publish the same at twitter @kackDev
+ Repost the twitter post @JosefBiehler
+ Repost the Insta in my story at @JosefBiehler
+ Publish the post at Instagram @JosefBiehler

Wow! Many steps that has to be done manually before I can annoy everyone with my bad drawings! 

I was asking myself if this can't be automated. Can it? Maybe!

# IFTTT
[**I**f **t**his **t**han **t**hat](https://ifttt.com) is a service where you can define workflows based upon start actions. E.g. "if I receive an email from xxx then send one to yyyy" and stuff like that.

It also provides Twitter, Instagram and Facebook integration. And it is free! Whoa!

**Accounts**

`IFTTT` allows only one Twitter/Instagram/Facebook connection per IFTTT account. As we want to control two social media profiles per platform, we need two `IFTTT` acccounts. In the remaining blog post I use the term `private IFTTT account` for that one that is connected to my private social media profiles. Accordingly I call my account that is linked to my `KackDev`social media profiles `KackDev IFTTT account`.
