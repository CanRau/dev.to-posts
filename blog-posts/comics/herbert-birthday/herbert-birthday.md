From time to time I am drawing cartoons with relation to our beloved programming doings. I am publishing them here, too. Have fun! Most of them will be in German but I am posting the english translation, too.
The main character in my developer cartoons is `Herbert`.

Herbert got a `PHP` book for his birthday. Maybe not the best idea.
