Long time ago I had a personal page that provides tutorials about many programming stuff. E.g. I showed how an oprating system can be built using Assembler. Or how the Win32 API can be used with ASM. Also some Delphi stuff was there and so on.

My page was very popular within a specific target group. I had good SEO ranks and all that stuff. But at some point in time I lost interest in writing tutorials. And also I had no time left because other (non programming related) projects became more important. 

Now in 2020 things have changed. I finished university in 2016, made a huge progress at work the last year. I started contributing to open source projects and built a few projects on github. Drawing is my new hobby since 2019 and it seems that this will be something I will do for years. I started using Twitter and Instagram more professional to promote my drawings and coding stuff and finally at the end of 2019 I came across dev.to and started to write tutorials again. I think I am now at a point where it makes sense to combine all those activities into one central website so I can provide it to those who are interested in (and of course, maybe exmployers are).

# What my personal page can and what it cannot do
Yes I am one of those poor people who must handle GDPR because I am from Germany. Also we have very strict laws. That are the main reasons for the following points:
+ No comments
    A comment functionality would involve a kind of an login. This would involve cookies and all that stuff and thus would force me to be GDPR compliant. To be honest, I can do so much more in the time that would be needed to fully understand the GDPR. And yes, there are many different intepretations and opinions. I don't think that a person like me and you can implement the GDPR 100% correct without asking a lawyer.
+ But I want comments!
    Of course people should be able to comment. A tutorial without interaction is senseless. So I will publish my blog posts regarding programming stuff here at dev.to and then link them at my website. No cookies, no accounts but fully functional!
